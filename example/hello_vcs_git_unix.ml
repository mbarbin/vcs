     [Stdlib] and running the [git] command line as an external process. *)

     users's config with some dummy values so we can use [commit] without having
     to worry about your user config on your machine. This isolates the test
     from your local settings, and also makes things work when running in the
     GitHub Actions environment, where no default user config exists. *)
