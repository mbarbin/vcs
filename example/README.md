# Vcs examples

In this directory we include some examples to illustrate how using `Vcs` looks
like.

Since there are several providers available (`Eio`, `Blocking`), we decided to
select on main provider that most examples will use. We selected `Eio` for this.

You can still have a look at `hello_blocking.ml` for an example showing how to
use the blocking interface of vcs.

The examples in this directory are not meant to be exhaustive, or replace the
tests that we have in other places in the repository. Rather they are intended
to give you a quick feel for what's `Vcs` and how to use it.

Welcome to Vcs' examples, and happy Giting!
