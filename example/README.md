# Vcs examples

In this directory we include some examples to illustrate how using `Vcs` looks like.

Since there are several backend available (`Eio`, `Unix`), we decided to select one main backend that most examples will use. We selected `Eio` for this.

The intended entry point to browse these examples is `hello_vcs.ml`.

You can still have a look at `hello_vcs_git_unix.ml` for an example showing how to use the unix backend of vcs.

The examples in this directory are not meant to be exhaustive, or replace the tests that we have in other places in the repository. Rather they are intended to give you a quick feel for what's `Vcs` and how to use it.

Welcome to Vcs' examples, and happy Giting!
