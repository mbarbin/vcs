# Testing the Git Command Line Interface Parsing Logic

This directory contains tests for the parsing logic implemented in the `Vcs_git_provider` module. The focus here is on validating the parsing of specific command outputs, rather than testing the entire process invocation. The latter is covered in the `Vcs_git_test` module.

## Testing Pattern

The pattern we use for testing involves the following steps:

1. **Capture Command Output**: We run specific Git commands and capture their output. This output represents the raw data that our library needs to parse.

2. **Create Test Cases**: We use the captured output to create test cases. Each test case includes the raw command output and the expected result after parsing.

3. **Run Tests**: In each test, we feed the raw command output to our parsing logic and compare the result to the expected output. If they match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

This approach allows us to ensure that our parsing logic can handle real-world command output. It also makes it easy to add new test cases: simply capture the output of a command and define the expected result.

For example, in the test file `test__refs.ml`, we test the parsing of the `git show-refs` command output. The output was captured and used to create a test case, which validates that the parsing is successful and produces the expected result.
