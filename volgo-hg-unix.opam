description: """\

[volgo] is a set of OCaml libraries for interacting with Git
repositories. It provides a type-safe and direct-style API to
programmatically perform Git operations, ranging from creating
commits and branches to loading and navigating commit graphs in
memory, computing diffs between revisions, and more.

[Volgo_hg_unix] implements a Mercurial backend for [volgo] based on
the OCaml standard library. It runs the [hg] CLI as a subprocess in
a blocking fashion, similar to the Stdlib's [Unix] module.
